# CSS-Grid-Focussed Admin Dashboard

**NOTE:** This project is specifically built for a 1920x1080 resolution. While responsive design is a critical part of web design, it is not covered until later in [The Odin Projects curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

In this project, I was tasked with creating an Admin Dashboard layout based off the below design image.

This project is part of the Intermediate HTML/CSS Chapter within [The Odin Projects curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I was directed to primarily use CSS Grid to layout my content. I used CSS Grid to layout everything with the exception of flexbox for the individual .card elements and .user elements.

My understanding of creating a grid, and then more grids within a grid, is proven with this project. I now have a great understanding of both CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox and how to use them together.
